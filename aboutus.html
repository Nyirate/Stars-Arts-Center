  <p> Art Garden is an area designed by our Art Center with a goal to bring "art, artists, and the community together through different activities in an open-air setting," the area serves as a gallery without walls and a space for creating art outside. We invite people and certain artists,and through this people get the oppotunity to meet their favorite artists and other inspiring ones..This happens the last Friday of every month.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_centre">learn more</a> </p> <br>
